### Plan

AZ-900 -> AZ-103 -> AZ-400

---
CapEx - Capital Expenditure (Expenses) - upfront costs. and predictable fixed costs. value decrease over time. resources can be a loss. In other words, spend on physical infrastructure up front. From accounting side of view like investments in the company (whole company cost grows)
OpEx - Operational Expenditure - ongoing billing costs, pay as you use it. test before committing. fantastic for agile and small business. resource can be deleted. In other words, spend on services as needed and get billed immediately. From accounting side of view like operational expenses and non-investments (company just spend the money).
Consumption based model - only pay for what is used, no upfront costs. You consume - you pay.
	- Enterprise agreement...

Azure and Azure Stack is not the same. They looks similar, but it is not. Azure stack is not good idea without Azure. Example: You have ship without internet, but you need to collect metrics while cruise. You buy Azure Stack on that ship, and when it in Port, you connect that Azure Stack to Azure and collect all the data in the cloud. Azure stack without Azure itself will be waste of money and resources.

IaaS - infrastructure as a service - uses computer services, that hosted on cloud provider. Service provider is responsible for everything, except: OS, configs and backups - that's is customer responsibility. (Your responsibility are: OS, middleware, runtime environment, data, applications). Most flexible.
PaaS - platform as a service - we are responsible only for our application and data. Provider will take care about infrastructure, os, management and backups, etc. Better productivity, as you focus only on your app.
SaaS - software as a service - provider responsible for everything, like MS teams, office 365, GMail, etc. Pay only for subscription, as example.
BaaS - backup as a service
DaaS - database as a service
IDaaS - Identity as a service

On-premises environments - we are responsible for everything: hardware, infrastructure, building, temperature, security, personal, etc. (networking, storage, servers, virtualization, OS, middleware, runtime environment, data, applications)

Public, Private, Hybrid clouds:

Private = as your house, you responsible for everything, even grass outside. Owned and operated only by organization that uses resources. Full control as advantage, but you need workers.
Public = as rented apartment, you responsible only for furniture inside, but does not care about everything outside. Owned by cloud services, which provides resources to multiple organizations and users. Typical access via secure, but internet connection. No CapEx, only OpEx.
Hybrid = as condo, you have flat inside building, you are owner of the flat, but other things inside or outside building is not your responsibility. Combines public and private to allow application use resources in most appropriate way.

## Core Azure Services

### Regions

**Region** is a geographical area on the planet containing *at least* one, but potentially multiple datacenters that are in close proximity and networked together with a low-latency network. Different regions has different price per virtual machine, traffic, etc.

Five geographies: Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa

Each geography has **Region** pair of region data center: Data resides in the same geography, for example Canada East and Canada Center.

Datacenters in Azure can be Public or Special.
Special regions:

- US Government (North America, DoD - Department of Defense)
- China 21 Vianet (East and North)
- Germany T-Systems data trustee (Central and NorthEast)

Some global Azure services that do not require you to select a region, such as Microsoft Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Azure Traffic Manager, or Azure DNS.

**Availability zones** (Region pairs): facilities, which physically separates location within an Azure region
Each zone has independent cooling, power and networking.
Three zones per region.
[IMG]
It helps with protection against datacenter failures, service interruptions, disasters or network/power outages. It is also an optional service.

**Availability Sets** is a metadata of your resources (like VM) and which helps Azure to allocate your resources in way that ensures that a virtual machine is online during maintenance or failure.
A virtual machine is assigned to an **Update Domain** and **Fault Domain**. Only one Update Domain would be updated at a time. Fault Domain provide physical isolation of data center.

**Update Domain (UD)** - scheduled maintenance or update, sequenced through update domain. (up to 20 (?))

**Fault Domain (FD)** - provide physical isolation of workloads across different hardware in data center. (up to 3 (?))

How to understand which region is better to you (from your host):

- https://www.azurespeed.com/Azure/Latency
- https://azurespeedtest.azurewebsites.net/

[Round trip between Azure regions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/azure-network-latency)

Price for one type of resource in different location will differ, hence choose Region based on latency and price, use [Price calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/) for Region comparison.

**Azure Resource Manager (ARM)** provides you a management layer in which resource groups and all the resources within it are created, configured, managed and deleted.
[ARM Template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) - is a JSON file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. A way to have infrastructure as code. You can download prepared ARM template on the step of creation resource, VM for example.

Hierarchy has the following levels (on each level you can manage permissions, which will be inherited and accumulated from top to bottom layers):

- Azure account
  - Management groups
    - Subscriptions (one or more)
      - Resource groups (one or more)
        - Resources (one or more)

**Resource group** - another core component as unit of management for resources in Azure.
Aggregates resources into single unit.
Allow to deploy, manage and monitor resources in a group
Resources in the same resource group should be the same lifespan, like one application.
Resource can only exist in a single resource group.
Not all, but most of the resources can be moved across/between resource groups
Resource can be assigned to different regions within a resource group
Deleting of resource group will also delete all associated resources
It helps also to group resources or/and give access only to certain resource group.


	You can manage with Azure Resource Manager, using: Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure Command Line Interface (CLI) or REST Clients
	With that Azure Resource Manager we can manage our resources, such as: virtual machines, web apps, storages, databases, etc.


**Azure Marketplace** - it is not a core component - there are customers can provide custom solutions and get royalty for using of their product in marketplace. ISV - Independent Software Vendor.

**Azure Compute** - core product, which includes:

- VMs - IaaS. self-explained.
- VM Scale Sets (VMSS) - IaaS. for automatic scale of identical VMs. Internal load balancer will be created with round-robin algorithm and health-check probe at level 4, or you can select application gateway, which will be on 7th level of OSI Model as application where you can do more conditions of your redirects, balancing or whatever you need, based on headers and other input parameters.
- Azure App Service - PaaS. offer to build, deploy and scale web, mobile or API apps.
- Serverless Computing (Azure Functions) - PaaS. is an event driven, compute-on-demand experience that extends the existing Azure application platform with capabilities to implement code triggered by events occurring in Azure or third party service as well.
- Container - PaaS. Allows to upload yor containers, which Azure will run for you.
- Kubernetes service - PaaS. Container Orchestration service for huge amount of containers.
- other services...

Azure Compute provides an on-demand service for running cloud-based apps.
Common resources are Disk, Processor, Memory, OS, Networking. Resources available in minutes or seconds. Pay per use.

**Azure Network Services**

- Azure Virtual Network - IaaS. Fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. VNet enables many types of Azure resources, such as Azure Virtual Machines (VM), to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.
- Azure Load Balancer - Help to scale identical VMs in automatic way. Works for either, public or internal networks.
- VPN Gateway - PaaS. To connect private and public clouds, for example.
- Application Gateway - Balancer on application level, can separate requests based on cookies, headers, URLs, etc, etc.
- CDN (Content Delivery Network) - helps to cache your content for specific region, closer to clients.
- other services...

Azure VMs:
	Infrastructure as a Service
	
Azure VMs Scale Sets:
	bunch of the same VMs, running at the same time. Provides HA, automatic scalability and load balancing
	Used in large scale instances, Season events (black friday, sport events, etc.)
	
Azure App Service:

Azure has two container services:
	Azure Container Instances - allow upload of your container to Azure for Execution, platfor as a service offering.
	Azure Kubernetes Service - an orchestration service, used to manage and update large numbers of containers
	
	
Azure Networking: - also core network. Azure Virtual Network (VNet) isolates and segments azure resources
	VNet securely connects various Azure resources and on-premises
	Provides filtering and routing of network traffic
	By default contained to one region. Virtual network peering can be used to connect different regions (Peering or VPN Gateway)
	VPN Gateway can be used to connect on-premises resources to Azure or to connect to another Azure network via public internet. Traffic is Encrypted.
	Only one VPN gateway allowed per VNet. Number of connection is based on SKU.
	
Azure Load Balancer:
	Distibutes traffic in, out and within the network
	Private and Public. For public or internal traffic.
	
Application Gateway - load balances web traffic only to web applications.
	Routes traffic based on source/destination IP and port
	Supports URL-based routing (traffic is directed, based on URL, /pics/ or /videos/*)
	etc.
	
CDN - Content Delivery Network.
	Globally distributed servers used to efficiently deliver web content in the user's region
	Content cached to minimize latency
	
**Azure Storage Services**

Stores files, messages and tables. Massively scalable, Durable and High available, secure. Supports Structured data, semi-structured data, unstructured data.

## Azure Security / Privacy / Compliance / Trust

In cloud you and your provided have shared responsibility for security, different levels depends on type of service (IaaS, PaaS, etc)

### Identity and Tools

- Azure Identity service:
  - Authentication (who you. like vehicle license/driver permit)
  - Authorization (what, when and where you can drive, what type of vehicle)
- Azure Active Directory: This is not classical AD. It is Cloud-based identity and access management service. Provides Authentication, SSO (Single sign-on), App management, B2B (pay per user(?)) and B2C (pay per authentication(?)) identity services, Device management.
- Azure Multi-factor Authentication: two or more elements for full authentication. Something you know (password), you have (phone), you are (fingerprint).
- Azure Security Center: Security monitoring service and management system for both, cloud and on-premises workloads. Evaluates the security of current resources. Provide recommendations and threat detection alerts. Automatically applies your security policies to any new resource or service you provision.
- Azure Key Vault: Central Repository to store applications secrets. Supports tokens, passwords, certs, and etc. Create and Control encryption keys. Provision, manage and deploy public and private SSL/TSL Certs. Storing secrets backed by hardware security modules (HSMs).
- Azure Information Protection (**AIP**): Organize and classify documents and e-mails by applying labels (confidential for internal use only, etc.). Automatic when using rules with conditions. Also can be applied manually for users.
- Azure Advanced Threat Protection (**ATP**): Identify compromised identities, advanced threats, insider actions, malicious attacks, etc. Brute force or Like you logged in 100 times from different countries for last five seconds and similar suspicious actions in Azure.
  - ATP Portal helps monitor and respond to suspicious activity
  - ATP Sensors installed directly in your domain controller
  - ATP Cloud service runs on Azure infrastructure

### Network Security

- Azure DDoS Protection: - Distributed denial access of service. Basic protection included by default and helps to sanitize unwanted network traffic. This service deploys only in Azure network.
- Azure Firewall: - Control access to Azure resources. Firewall as a Service (FaaS). Applies in/outbound traffic filtering rules, unrestricted cloud stability. Uses Azure Monitor for logging.
- NSG: Network Security Groups: Allow or Deny network traffic to and from resources in an Azure VNet subnet. Rules are processed in priority order. Lower processed first. NSG set inbound and outbound rules to filter by source and destination IP, port and protocol.
- ASG: Application Security Group: Group virtual machines across virtual networks. It allows to filter traffic to the virtual machines in the security group, not the network. Allows to segment virtual machines, based on applications, like web server. Allows you to reuse your security policy at scale without manual maintenance of explicit IP addresses. Handles complexity of explicit IP addresses and multiple rule sets.
- WAF: Web Application Firewall. Can be used as internal or external firewall for web apps.

As example, to choose Azure Network Security solution, you need for **perimeter layer** (outside of your network): Azure DDoS Protection and Azure Firewall. And on **networking layer** you should use NSG and ASG to permit traffic only between networked resources. You also can combine it: like Azure Firewall + NSG + WAF.

### Azure Governance Methodologies, Monitoring and Reporting

- Azure Policies: Policies enforce rules over azure resources, ensures the resource is compliant. Stay compliant with your corporate standards and rules. Azure policies can be described in JSON format. Most of policies can be as allow action (and mark as compliant), deny action or just audit (log in journal). Already created resources (before policy creation) will be marked as non-compliant resources.
- Initiatives: group of policies, that manages as single unit. It reduces the complexity of multiple policies. Helps to track compliance at greater scope.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Role based access management control without additional cost, available for all Azure subscribers. Default roles are: Owner, Contributor, Reader. You can create your own custom roles. Like VM Manager or Network Operator with appropriate access permissions only to VM or Network resources. Custom role should be described in JSON file and created over CLI.
- Azure Locks: prevents deletion or modification of a resource. CanNotDelete; ReadOnly. Manage locks at subscription, resource group or at individual resource level.
- Azure Advisor Security Assistance: provide a list of security recommendations, integrates with Azure Security Center, you can see recommendations at Azure Advisor Dashboard. It is just advices, not required actions.
- Azure Blueprints: Allows an engineer or an architect to sketch a project's design parameters, Azure Blueprints enables cloud architects and central information technology groups to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implements and adheres to an organization's standards, patterns, and requirements. Blueprint contains: role assignment, policy, ARM templates (Azure Resource Manager) and Resource Groups. It also helps with association of blueprints with specific Azure DevOps build artifacts, pipelines, releases, deployments and etc.

### Monitor and Reporting

- Azure Monitor: Collect and analyze metrics from cloud or on-premise environments. Helps to monitor availability and performance of resources using metrics and logs. (app monitoring data, guest os metrics, azure resource metrics, etc). Starts collecting data after you add your first resource under your subscription. **Activity logs** collects all events (add, edit, remove), **Metrics** measures performance of resources and resource consumption. You can add monitor agent to resource for operational data collecting. You can collect info only about resources inside Azure environment. And act, based on collected info, create rules and do trigger actions for action groups.
- Azure Service Health: Dashboard, which provides insight into Azure and your resources, Azure Status, Azure Service and Resource Health.
- Tags: Group related resources. A Tag is a metadata, which contains a name and pair value. You can organize your resources as logical groups.

Privacy, Compliance and Data Protection requirements

- Industry Compliance Terms:
  - GDPR: General Data Protection Regulation
  - HIPAA: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
  - CJIS: Criminal Justice Information Services

## Pricing & Support

Azure Subscriptions: provide to you authenticated and authorized access to Azure and allow to provision resources

- Allows resources to be created and managed. Links to Azure AD for authentication and authorization.
- One Account can have one or multiple subscriptions that have different billing models and to which you apply different policies.
- Options: Pay-As-You-Go; Free account; Member offers; Enterprise agreement and etc.
- Limits: Service limits for each subscription type. Some Service limits can be increased, some not.
- Subscription Billing Boundary: determines how an Azure account is billing according to billing requirements (different currencies, as example and etc).
- Subscription Access Control Boundary (to organization departments): will apply policies at the subscription level, hence you can create different subscriptions to separate organizational structures.
- Management groups - Group of Azure objects in a collection, like container, which allow you to manage policies, access, and compliance for the entire group. It provide you a further level of classification beyond subscriptions. In short: it's just group of subscription and make sense if you have a lot of it.

Azure Planning and Management Costs:

- Web Direct: Regular customers, which sign up for Azure via Azure website (portal), this method required credit card. Wide-available. Available: Pay-as-you-go with quotas and limits or Reserved instances of resources or services with fixed price.
- Enterprise Agreement: Enterprise company sign agreement with Azure for spending amount of money for Azure services in specific period of time. Annual payments (up-front in most of cases).
- CSP (Cloud Solution Provider): Typically Microsoft partner that build their own specific solutions on top of Azure with it's own billing and payment.

Factors, affecting costs of Azure:

- Resource: Cost of resource depends on it's type, size, limits (quotas), and etc.
- Services: Azure rates and billing for services can differ between type of agreement and subscription: enterprise, web direct, csp and etc.
- Locations: Azure infrastructure distributed globally, so cost of usage same resource or same amount of service (VM or Database, for example) may vary between different locations (regions).

Billing Zones (mostly about network traffic):

- Don't charge for ingress (inbound in Azure datacenters) traffic.
- But will bill you for Egress (outbound of Azure datacenters) traffic.
- Geographical zones (groups):
  - Zone 1: West US, East US, Europe
  - Zone 2: Australia Central, Japan West, Central India

undestand cloud concepts
public, private, hybrid
IaaS, PaaS, SaaS and serverless

The most basic category of cloud computing services. With IaaS, you rent IT infrastructure—servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, operating systems—from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis

Platform as a service refers to cloud computing services that supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering, and managing software applications. PaaS is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network, and databases needed for development.

Software as a service is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure, and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching. Users connect to the application over the Internet, usually with a web browser on their phone, tablet, or PC.

Serverless computing
Overlapping with PaaS, serverless computing focuses on building app functionality without spending time continually managing the servers and infrastructure required to do so. The cloud provider handles the setup, capacity planning, and server management for you. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, only using resources when a specific function or trigger occurs.


Azure Service Bus
	It's message broker. Data transfered between applications and services with binary messages. Scenarios: Messaging (journals, orders, etc); Decouple applications. Improve reliability and scalability of applications and services. Client and service don't have to be online at the same time. ; Topics and subscriptions. Enable 1:n relationships between publishers and subscribers.; - Message sessions. Implement workflows that require message ordering or message deferral.
	- Namespace - is a container for all messaging components, often serve as application container.
	- Queue - point-to-point communication. stores messages until recieving application is available to recieve and process them.
	- Topic - useful in publish/subscribe scenarios. Can have multiple independent subscriptions to recieve all messages sent to a topic. You can youse rules and filters to define conditions that trigger optional actions.
	- Message sessions - used to create FIFO (first-in, first-out)
	- Autoforwarding - chains a queue or subscription to another topic or queue.
	- Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) - A DLQ holds messages that can't be delivered to any receiver. It holds messages that can't be processed. Service Bus lets you remove messages from the DLQ and inspect them.An application might, with help of an operator, correct issues and resubmit the message, log the fact that there was an error, and take corrective action. From an API and protocol perspective, the DLQ is mostly similar to any other queue, except that messages can only be submitted via the dead-letter operation of the parent entity. In addition, time-to-live isn't observed, and you can't dead-letter a message from a DLQ. The dead-letter queue fully supports peek-lock delivery and transactional operations.
	- Scheduled delivery - You can submit messages to a queue or topic for delayed processing. You can schedule a job to become available for processing by a system at a certain time.
	- Message deferral - A queue or subscription client can defer retrieval of a message until a later time. This deferral might be because of special circumstances in the application. The message remains in the queue or subscription, but it's set aside.
	Batching - Client-side batching enables a queue or topic client to delay sending a message for a certain period of time. If the client sends additional messages during this time period, it transmits the messages in a single batch.
	Transactions - groups two or more operations together into an execution scope. Service Bus supports grouping operations against a single messaging entity within the scope of a single transaction. A message entity can be a queue, topic, or subscription.
	Filtering and actions - Subscribers can define which messages they want to receive from a topic. These messages are specified in the form of one or more named subscription rules. For each matching rule condition, the subscription produces a copy of the message, which can be differently annotated for each matching rule.
	Autodelete - Autodelete on idle enables you to specify an idle interval after which a queue is automatically deleted.
	Duplicate detection - An error could cause the client to have a doubt about the outcome of a send operation. Duplicate detection enables the sender to resend the same message. Another option is for the queue or topic to discard any duplicate copies.
	Security protocols - Service Bus supports security protocols such as Shared Access Signatures (SAS), Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and Managed identities for Azure resources.
	Geo-DR - When Azure regions or datacenters experience downtime, Geo-disaster recovery enables data processing to continue operating in a different region or datacenter.
	Service Bus supports standard AMQP 1.0 and HTTP/REST protocols.




Azure Queue Storage --- /????

**Azure Cloud Services** - community suggests not to use this service, because it has outdated API, doesn't have appropriate updates and have other legacy-stale solution issues. Just avoid to use it in the future. See more details at [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50033033/what-is-azure-cloud-service) and [github](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/issues/11861)

### General Terms and difference between them

*High Availability* - is software used to ensure that systems are running and available most of the time. High availability is a high percentage of time that the system is functioning. It can be formally defined as (1 – (down time/ total time))*100%. Although the minimum required availability varies by task, systems typically attempt to achieve 99.999% (5-nines) availability. This characteristic is weaker than fault tolerance, which typically seeks to provide 100% availability, albeit with significant price and performance penalties.

High availability software is measured by its performance when a subsystem fails, its ability to resume service in a state close to the state of the system at the time of the original failure, and its ability to perform other service-affecting tasks (such as software upgrade or configuration changes) in a manner that eliminates or minimizes down time. All faults that affect availability – hardware, software, and configuration need to be addressed by High Availability Software to maximize availability.

Big-O - 

Scalability - Scalability is the ability of a program to scale. For example, if you can do something on a small database (say less than 1000 records), a program that is highly scalable would work well on a small set as well as working well on a large set (say millions, or billions of records).

	Like gap said, it would have a linear growth of resource requirements. Look up Big-O notation for more details about how programs can require more computation the larger the data input gets. Something parabolic like Big-O(x^2) is far less efficient with large x inputs than something linear like Big-O(x).

	Scalability can be achieved in 2 ways:

	Vertical - In this way, you add more hardware like more RAM, processor or more nodes. You also introduce load balancer, which will help in routing the incoming calls to various servers based on the routing algorithm used. The application is now able to handle more load as load is being shared across the servers.

	Horizontal - In horizontal scaling, you architect/design the application in such a way that it can behave well in case of more parallel traffic. You check how you are managing the memory, sessions , cache & state etc. If you are using the session to maintain the user information, under heavy load single server could be more busy managing the servers, so in this case you can check possibility of going stateless. It can also respond to incoming requests from same user in parallel instead serial replies which happens if sessions are being used.

	When talking about systems scalability, we usually differentiate between

	"Scale up" - the ability to grow by using stronger hardware
	"Scale out"- the ability to grow by adding more hardware

Scalability and Elasticity are very similar, first mostly about physical opportunities, second about flexible management of resources

Elasticity - 
Agility - 
Fault Tolerance - 
Disaster Recovery - 
Global Reach - 
Customer Latency Capability - 
Predictive cost considerations - 
Security - 

Container - virtualized environment, but not VM. Container don't include OS, should be lightweight and designed to be created, scaled out and removed dynamically and in short period of time.

AZ-900 questions (cracking the Azure questions):

- Which of the following services from the below list are part of the Azure Compute service offerings?
- Which of the following statements are true about Resource groups?
- Finish the following sentence. Azure Management Groups operate at a level of scope that is...?
- Complete the following sentence. General Availability (GA) features are available as..?
  - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/blog/announcing-the-general-availability-of-azure-ultra-disk-storage/
- Count benefits of using cloud
  - you can have stage (uat/pre-prod) as the same as prod easier.
- Which type of cloud will give you more flexibility
- Which cloud you should choose for legacy app with specific hardware
- Which cloud you should choose for new app with common hardware
- What is the best way to separate PROD, UAT (Stage), TEST and DEV Environments in Azure?
  - You can separate it at least as different Resource Groups, or better to have different subscription for each environment. It is also depends of resources amount for your application.
- How updates on Azure hardware will affect my VM on it?
  - You will recieve notification about planned update with desired date. Due to this date (usually one month+) you should able to login into your portal and move your affected VMs or other resources in different hardware node at what time you prefer (can safely do it). Otherwise, if you will not do that, Microsoft will freeze you VM or other resource during update, without moving it to another node. In some exceptional cases you should contact technical support and discuss with them all the details.
- What cons of serverless computing?
  - Mostly it is dependency of vendor, because if you have solution and need to move to another vendor, you need to fully re-write all your solution for specifications of new Vendor. Example: Azure Functions -> AWS Lambda.
